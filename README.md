Flash Card App (French-English) â€“ Python + Tkinter

A simple yet interactive flash card application built with Python and Tkinter. This app helps users learn basic French vocabulary by flipping cards between French and English.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project was created as part of the *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp* by Dr. Angela Yu (Day 31â€“34). The app uses a clean GUI interface to display a French word, waits 3 seconds, then flips the card to reveal its English translation.

## ðŸ–¥ Features

- Flip animation using `window.after()` and image replacement
- Random word selection from a dataset of French-English vocabulary
- "Known" and "Unknown" buttons to simulate spaced repetition (expandable feature)
- Clean, beginner-friendly code using Python and Tkinter

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Pandas (for data handling)
- CSV file input for word data

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- How to build GUIs using Tkinter: canvas, buttons, images, layout
- How to use `window.after()` to trigger timed events
- Loading and manipulating data using pandas
- Managing global state (like `current_card`) in small projects
